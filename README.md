#### Other Info
A resource pack is now required to play on the server. When joining, just click allow and it will automatically install the resource pack. It's nothing to worry about, and it won't change any textures for blocks or anything. It's for the Vane plugin to allow its features to work.  
Ha, as if we're ever going to have that many people playing, but that much overhead makes for a buttery smooth server experience.
