## The Core
On this page, you'll find info about our server's core. 

### The Basis
Our server is based on [<span style="color:red">Paper</span>](http://papermc.io), which is a high-performance fork of CraftBukkit.  
Paper allows for more responsive loading of chunks, and can handle more players at once which reduces our ping.  

### The Essentials Plugin
Our server also runs a plugin called essentials, and that plugin also makes up a part of the server's core. Essentials allows everything from warps to flying and more. It handles the sleeping of players, gamemodes, time of day, and much much more.  
#### Essentials and Paper together are what distinguish our server from a vanilla Minecraft Server.
