## Our Server's Origin Story

### Beginnings
It all begun when back in 2019, Simren opened the very first Minecraft Server for us to play on. It had no plugins, no cheats, and especially no keepInventory. For some of us, it was quite a different experience, because we were used to having keepInventory turned on. It was quite literally a reminder of how painful death was in Minecraft.  

The server started out running Minecraft 1.14.2, and overtime, Simren slowly updated versions until she eventually stopped being able to maintain the server due to time constraints. After about a year of Simren hosting the server, she passed it over to Gabe since he was able to host the server 24/7. And then the server's evolution began.

### Phase 1
Once Gabe had taken ownership of the server, he immediately updated it from version 1.15.2 to 1.16.4, enabling the players to experience the new nether, and get netherite gear for the first time. The server slowly expanded, gaining new buildings, new experiences, all while Julian gathered more coal and iron than anyone could ever need (not to mention Redstone too). Life was great. The server was progressing and the village in the server was thriving.

### Phase 2

Eventually, Gabe came across a fork of BukkitMC called PaperMC, which they called 'High Performance Minecraft'. Though the name sounds cringe, it was extremely high performance. Server ping dropped by over 40 ms, CPU usage went down to near 10%, and the server's security increased too. PaperMC also supports plugins, which Gabe also slowly trickled into the server over time. The first plugin Gabe installed was Essentials. Oh boy, was this great. Server administration was much easier, since errors were recorded in much greater detail. Essentials didn't come without its caviats though, and Gabe had to slowly work through the inconveniences it brought, the main one being where one person sleeping would skip the whole server to dayime, whereas now the server waits for all players to be sleeping before skipping.

### Phase 3

Over time, as the server grew, Gabe was able to section off his own section of the world (similar to what we have now) and build a magestic City with dozens of buildings. Thanks to plugins, Gabe was able to build roads and have street signs, as well as driveable cars! Things were great. Simren and her friends, as well as Emi, Juli and Gabe had built an extensive network of paths all leading to buildings and structurs, farms and more that were all built by hand in survival mode. 

### The Great Corruption
On June 25th, 2020, there was a power surge in Toronto that caused the computer that the server was being hosted on to short circuit, which corrupted the entire computer. Luckily, that computer had an SSD, so the data on the drive was not affected. What was affected, though, was the server. Since Minecraft servers store their data in RAM and only push the updated data to the SSD periodically, the world save became corrupted. Massive chunks of the world were deleted, and all our hard work was lost. 

### Rebuilding the Server
After this incident, Simren announced that she once again had time to host the server (her acadamic year had ended), and she then started hosting the server again, starting from scratch. People played on the server, building a new village froun the ground up. 6800 minecraft days later, and after hundreds of hours of playing, our server expanded and was made into what we have today.
