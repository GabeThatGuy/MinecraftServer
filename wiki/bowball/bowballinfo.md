## BowBall Game
#### By Gabe
> The fundamentals of this page can be found within the game at the BowBall court, but it is still highly recommended to read this page if you are not playing with Gabe or have not memorized the rules!

## Instructions
There shall be a maximum of two teams, each with a maximum of six players. The goal of each player is to shoot the targets (white and red block that are located at various locations on the nets) with a bow. A successful shot will illuminate the light inside the net, indicating how many points were received. The length of a game shall be 8 minutes or 40 minutes, and should be conducted in 4 quarters. Each quarter shall be 2 minutes long (8 minute game) or 10 minutes (40 minute game). After each game, the scores from all players should be summed and then the winner of the game shall be determined.

## Pre-Game Preparation
Players shall go to the Armoury and Player Cache room at the BowBall court and empty their inventory (including armour slots) into their respective cache. They shall then equip themselves with a Bow from the armoury, and four stacks (256) arrows from the ammunition barrel. Then, each team shall go to their half of the court and wait for the referee to start the game. 

> Note: There are only six bows in the Armoury, so in situations where there are more than three people on each team, players may use their own bow for the game.

### Inside the Arc
- 5 points for scoring above the rim.
- 1 point for scoring below the rim.
