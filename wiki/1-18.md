## Minecraft 1.18 Info  
On this page, you'll find all kinds of info regarding Minecraft 1.18 & what it brings to the table for our server.

### Our Server and the New Chunk Generation
So, there were a lot of changes to chunk generation in this update that completely changes the way worlds are structured. Bedrock level is now at y=-64, and the build limit is now at y=320.  
Giant caves, cliffs and ore veins can now be found, plus geodes and other mineral deposits can now be found in existing 1.17 chunks. Just dig below y=0 and you'l be in the new terrain.  

### This page will be continually updated as more information about 1.18's effects on our server become known.
