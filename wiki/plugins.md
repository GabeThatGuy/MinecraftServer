## Essentials
This plugin is the **backbone** of our server. It's what makes things tick.  
Essentials enables things like tick monitoring, memory management, warps, shortened commands, different weather patterns, as well as many other game rules.

## Vane
Vane is one of the biggest plugins on our server. It adds the following:  

### Quality of Life Improvements  
- Enhanced Grass Paths  
  - You'll run faster on grass paths, so it's worth using them!  

- Simple Harvesting  
  - Right click on a fully-grown plant, and it will collect the harvest while simultaneously planting the corresponding seeds from your inventory!  

- Double Doors  
  - Double doors will open simultaneously.  

- Chest Sorting
  - When a button is pressed next to a chest, that chest's contents will get sorted.    

- Creeper Protection
  - Nobody likes creepers that blow up half your world. Vane does something about that, but with style.  

### New Items

- Sickles
  - Sickles are used for harvesting large amounts of crops in a short period of time.  
  - Right click with a sickle in hand and it will harvest and re-plant a radius 2 circle of where you click.   

- Files
  - Files allow you to change the individual joints of walls, fences, glass panes, etc, as well as allowing you to change the rotation of stairs.  

- XP Bottles  
  - You can store XP in bottles by right clicking an XP Bottle in your hand.  

- Scrolls
  - There are two kinds of scrolls in Vane: the Home Scroll and the Unstable Scroll.  
  - The Home Scroll will teleport you to your last spawnpoint (bed). Note! It only has 25 uses, so it's worth enchanting with Unbreaking.  
  - The Unstable Scroll works just like the Home Scroll, except it will teleport you to where you last used any scroll.  

- Decorative Heads  
  - 32075 Heads are available from the /heads menu.  

- Netherite Elytra  
  - Combine an Elytra with a netherite ingot in the smithing table to get an Elytra with +6 Armor! (Netherite Chestplate has +8 Armor)  


### Enchantments
Vane adds several enchantments that can be applied to various items for new or better functionality.

#### Basis
Enchantments in Vane are based on the Ancient Tome. These can be found in chests all across the world.  
Ancient Tomes are used to craft two new Tomes that form the base for the enchantment recipes.  
1. Ancient Tome of Knowledge
2. Ancient Tome of the Gods
