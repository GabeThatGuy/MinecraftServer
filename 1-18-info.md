## Our server and the road to Minecraft 1.18

### Background Info
So basically, Minecraft 1.18 is the biggest update in the history of Minecraft, changing the entirety of the world generation algorithm. It basically makes it so that mountains are taller, caves are deeper, and so on. 

### When is 1.18 coming?
Minecraft 1.18 releases on November 30, 2021. Our server will likely adopt 1.18 when essentials adds support for the version, and when paper's 1.18 jar is released. 

### But why is this important?
Well, In order to update from our lovely 1.17.1 world to 1.18, we have to hope and pray that Minecraft has some kind of conversion method so that we can keep using our world in 1.18. If not, the server is going to stay as 1.17.1 and I will open a new server on a different port that will run version 1.18. I really hope it doesnt come to that because I really want to be able to use the world we have in 1.18 and not lose the entirety of our progress.

### 1.18's New Chunk Generation
Unlike previous updates, 1.18's chunks won't be kilometres away from the village. In fact, all of the new caves and geodes will simply generate below y=0 and not have any effect whatsoever on the chunks we've built in. It's pretty great.
